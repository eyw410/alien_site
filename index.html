    <h4>
      Motivation: People often think of aliens as scary beings with bad
      intentions. I wanted to subvert that notion and invent inhabitants of a
      "faraway planet" who are ridiculously happy. Unfortunately, I think that a
      planet filled with joy and playfulness would be considered quite strange
      and unfamiliar to us.
      <br />
      <br />
      So, I drew these aliens on PowerPoint and made these gifs (using
      https://icons8.com/animizer/en/animate-static-image and
      https://gifmaker.me/). Sure, having unlocked the secrets of happiness and
      peace, these creatures might be light-years smarter than us and have the
      ability to process and enjoy sensory input much faster than we do, but
      they still make sure we can share in their happiness! :)
      <br />

      This music was produced with GarageBand's piano that you can play using
      your computer keyboard. The song has a theme and variations form, with a
      human-speed theme and alien-speed variations. Furthermore, there is a
      theme with melodic variations within each part.
